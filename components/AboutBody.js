        I am software developer John Dulaney. I am currently enrolled in a full stack software development program at the Nashville Software School.
        
        A short little bio: I was born November 22nd, 1988 in Knoxville Tennessee and have been living between East and middle TN my whole life, save the 5 years I attended a military academy in Missouri (Wentworth Military Academy). I graduated and Commissioned as an officer in the National Guard from there and soon attended the University of Missouri where a car accident ended my Army career and left me in a wheelchair. I have since returned to the Nashville area and attend Nashville Software School. I am proudly part of NSS Cohort 22, a class learning full stack JS/AngularJS front end with a C#/.NET focused backend.
